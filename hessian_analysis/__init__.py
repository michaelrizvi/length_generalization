"""
Hessian analysis module for algorithmic tasks.

This module provides utilities and scripts for computing and visualizing
Hessian eigenvalue analysis for trained models on algorithmic tasks.

Main components:
- utils.py: Core functions for loading models and computing Hessian metrics
- plot_hessian_simple.py: Plot analysis for a single model checkpoint
- plot_hessian_many_models.py: Compare Hessian analysis across multiple models
